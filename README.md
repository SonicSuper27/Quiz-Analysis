# Quiz-Analysis
Personalized Quiz Performance Analysis and Recommendation System
Logic and Approach
1. Data Exploration
Current Quiz Data:
Analyze the user’s latest submission to identify the following:
Topics covered in the quiz.
Correct vs. incorrect responses.
Difficulty level of the attempted questions.
Response map (mapping of question IDs to selected option IDs).
Assess the performance at the question level.
Historical Quiz Data:
Aggregate and analyze data from the last 5 quizzes to track trends in:
Accuracy by topic.
Performance by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
Average scores and progress over time.
Repeated mistakes (questions/topics where the user consistently struggles).
2. Pattern Identification
Topic Analysis:
Identify topics where the user performs well and struggles.
Measure topic accuracy by calculating the percentage of correct responses.
Difficulty Analysis:
Evaluate performance based on question difficulty levels (e.g., low accuracy in hard questions vs. high accuracy in easy ones).
Trend Analysis:
Highlight improvements or declines in performance over time.
Response Accuracy:
Identify questions or question types where users tend to select incorrect options repeatedly.
3. Insights Generation
Weak Areas:
Topics with accuracy below a defined threshold (e.g., <60%).
Difficulty levels where performance lags.
Specific questions consistently answered incorrectly.
Improvement Trends:
Highlight topics where the user has shown growth over the last few quizzes.
Track improvements in scores or accuracy by difficulty.
Performance Gaps:
Pinpoint topics or question types with significant performance gaps compared to the user’s strengths.
4. Recommendations
Suggest focus areas based on weak topics.
Recommend specific question types (e.g., multiple-choice, case studies) for practice.
Propose practice questions at specific difficulty levels to strengthen weak areas.
Provide topic-focused learning materials or resources.
5. Bonus: Student Persona
Develop a “student persona” based on performance patterns:
Achiever: High performance across all topics, with slight difficulty in hard questions.
Topic Specialist: Excels in a few topics but struggles with others.
Steady Improver: Shows consistent growth but needs targeted improvement in specific areas.
Surface Learner: Performs well in easy questions but struggles with medium and hard ones.
Include creative labels and visualizations to personalize feedback.
Sample Insights and Recommendations
Weak Topic: Geometry

Accuracy: 45%
Recommendation: Focus on foundational geometry concepts. Practice with medium and hard difficulty geometry questions.
Suggested Resources: Links to geometry tutorials and quizzes.
Strength: Algebra

Accuracy: 90%
Recommendation: Maintain practice to reinforce strengths. Attempt harder questions for a challenge.
Difficulty Gap: Hard Questions

Accuracy in Hard Questions: 50% (vs. 80% in Easy Questions).
Recommendation: Gradually increase practice with hard questions across all topics.
Improvement Trend: Probability

Improvement: 20% increase in accuracy over 5 quizzes.
Recommendation: Continue focused practice to sustain improvement.
Implementation Details
Schema Design and Data Flow:

Current Quiz Data: Fetched via Quiz API for real-time insights.
Historical Quiz Data: Aggregated from the last 5 quizzes using API calls.
Response mapping and accuracy are computed in-memory for analysis.
Visualization Tools:

Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create performance heatmaps, line charts (progress trends), and bar graphs (topic-wise accuracy).
Use Python (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) for API creation and integration.
Technology Stack:

Python for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy).
Flask/FastAPI for backend development.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for insights.
GitHub for code hosting.
Video tools (e.g., Loom) for demo recording.
